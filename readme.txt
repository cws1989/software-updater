SoftwareLauncher, SoftwarePatchBuilder and SoftwarePatchDownloader share many 
identical/common files, those files are put into SoftwareUpdaterCommon. Here 
uses symbolic links to link those file needed from SoftwareUpdaterCommon to 
other three projects.

If you are using linux, please run linux_symbolic_links.sh.

If you are using Windows, if your version is Vista or up, you can run 
win_vista_symbolic_links.bat with administrative right (Note you can't just 
right click and 'Run as Administrator', you have to run cmd as an 
administrator, then change directory to this directory, then run the bat). If 
your version if XP or lower, you can run win_xp_copy.bat, which will use copy 
files instead of symbolic links.
